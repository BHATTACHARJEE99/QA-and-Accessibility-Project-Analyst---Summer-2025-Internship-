# QA-and-Accessibility-Project-Analyst---Summer-2025-Internship-
Led post-migration QA and accessibility optimization for the University of North Texas College of Engineering website, where initial scores fell short of standards. Using Siteimprove, Modern Campus CMS, and Smartsheet, identified and resolved broken components, missing alt text, and link/dependency issues, while collaborating with developers and design experts to enhance UI/UX and WCAG 2.1 compliance. Achieved a QA score increase from ~50 to 89.7 (+40 points) and accessibility score improvement from ~65 to 78.3 (+14 points), resulting in 14,362 additional site visits and establishing a repeatable QA pipeline for future site maintenance.
